              <br>
              <h2 class="display-6">Reflection</h2>
              <p class="lead">The first task was to ask for the user’s name and their favorite animal. The output should be: “Hello [name]. Your favorite animal is the [favAni]”. I was surprised it was a simple task. Making variables and putting the value into a sentence via concatenation was nice. The 2nd task was to ask the user to enter a number, then print that number again 3 times. I used the input function to get the value and cast the string to an integer. It was simple but the challenge was to remember to change the string to a number. The 3rd task was to ask the user to enter 3 test scores as integers. Then print out the average of the numbers. It was basic mathematics. It was fun because I like math. The 4th task was to ask the user to enter in 3 words, then print the words in reverse order. This was a simple task that was like the  first problem. The last task was to ask the user to enter two integers. I should then find the area of the rectangle. My favorite part was to create a rectangle using dashes. It was easy to complete the task. Overall, this was a good assignment for practicing the skills we have learned. </p>

              <p class="lead">We created different type of calculators.</p>
              <br>
              <h2 class="display-6">Reflection</h2>
              <p class="lead">This was one of my favorite assignments during the term because I made different calculators. The calculators were: 
                <br>
              Area Calculator, 
              Perimeter Calculator, 
              Tip calculator, and a  
              Volume Calculator. 
                <br>
              The area of a rectangle calculator was easy because I have already completed the assignment in DONOW U1L11. It was a good refresher on all of the concepts that I had learned early in the year. 
<br>
              The perimeter of a rectangle calculator was a challenge because I forgot how to find the perimeter but after I remembered it was simple to add all of the values and finding the perimeter of a rectangle by adding the length * 2 and width*2 was a breeze 

              It was fun to add the rectangle shapes to the code. 
<br>
              The 20% tip calculator was my favorite one to code because it gave me the most challenge. Percentage was not my favorite topic in Math and is a concept that I make mistakes on my times. I am proud that I was able to figure out how to calculate tips on the first try. 
<br>
              Lastly, the Volume calculator was my least favorite because it was easier to do. I asked for 3 values and multiplied them together to the volume of a cuboid. 
<br>
              If I could edit the code I would have made the user choose what calculator they would have liked to use. 

              I am proud of my work and Iit is one of my prized projects.

              <p class="lead">This project is in my top 3 favorite assignments that I completed this Term. I believe it is one of my most successful works because I created a fully functioning calculator using the math operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  I very enjoyed testing my code in between and seeing that I worked. I was introduced to if statements that test is true or not. I like that the user has the ability to input the symbol of the operation and the math would still work. To strengthen the code, I would import the math module and add more operation like square rooting a number. </p>

              <p class="lead">I wrote a program called "Test Grader". The program should allow the user to enter a test mark between 1 and 100
              If the number entered is too high or too low, a message should be displayed informing the user of this. I was to create a variable called Fail
              If the test result is less than 40 they have FAILED - assign the value “Y” to your Fail variable
              If the test result is greater or equal to 40, it is a PASS - assign the value “N” to your Fail variable
              Check the value of Fail - if it is NOT EQUAL to “N” print a message saying “Retake required”

              CHALLENGE

              The program should then also work out and print the grade as follows:<br>
              Under 40: A "U" grade<br>
              40 - 59: A "C" grade<br>
              60 - 79: A "B" grade<br>
              80 or over: An "A" grade</p>

              <p class="lead">I really enjoyed this project because I felt like a teacher that is grading students' work. The Challenge was my favorite part of the assignment because it made the program feel more like a Test Grader. The program that converts the numeric grade into a letter that represents whether they are passing or not and by how much. If I could edit the code I would make the program ask how many tests you would like to grade and  find the average. Then it will give you the final score. The program help me see how IF ELSE statements are used in everyday lives and can be used to grade assignments.</p>

              <p class="lead">We had to modify the starter code. I had to add a line of code asking the user to enter a third number. I also had to edit the IF/ELIF/ELSE statements to confirm whether the third number is bigger/smaller/the same as the first number and whether it is bigger/smaller/the same as the second number. Also if all three numbers are the same.</p>

              <p class="lead">I like this project because it is a simple concept but it can be confused very quickly. I got confused on what numbers I am comparing. The code was repetitive so I would get the less than and greater than sign confused which caused confusion in my conditional statements and ultimately an error. This assignment made me pay closer attention to my code. It would have helped if I had commented on the explanation of the objective of the different lines.</p>

              <p class="lead">This was one of the most complicated projects I have completed this term. We were instructed to make clocks. When the user inputs a time, the clock would remind the user what should occur at that time. The confusion occurred when all of the times were included except 8. I had to sweep through the code multiple times to see what was the reason for the error. Eventually, I found that a conditional was missing an “=”. Overall, it was an enjoyable project and a great practice for elif, if, and else statements.</p>

I adapted the code to get user input into the number variable. Then a change the print statement so it outputs 'number' multiplied by 'counter' equals 'product'
              Make the counter increase by 2 every loop
              Add a line once the loop has finished to output 'The loop has finished'</p>

              <p class="lead">The code was easy to do because it was Math based. It was tedious to write comments about everything but it really helped with me understanding the code better. If I could improve the code more, I would limit the number between 1 and 12 and if the user typed in a number below 1 or above 12 then the program would stop and tell the user to pick a number between the range.</p>
